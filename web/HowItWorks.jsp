            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 align='center'>It's Easy</h3>
            <p>Using the Nomad Carpool system is extremely easy. In fact, it's the most intuitively user friendly software on the planet. It's so easy to use
                that you automatically already know exactly how to use it, just by being human.</p>
                Just follow the four simple steps below.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sign Up For either a Driver or Rider account</li>       
                <li>Post your schedule</li>
                <li>Search for others traveling to the same destinations</li>
                <li>Request a ride from a driver, or request someone to ride with you</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That's it! It's really that easy.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 align='center'>Features</h3>
            <p><strong>Easily create and manage</strong> your own custom schedule. Create your schedule, personalize it, and post it.
                Don't ask me how to do it. Just go do it!</p>
            <p>The Nomad webapp is also equipped with a geo-locater so wherever you go Nomad knows, and so does our staff, and our parent companies,
            as well as anyone who may be interested in purchasing that information from us, but don't worry about that. All that you need to know
            is that this fancy geo-locater will help you easily find other people near you who are also carpooling. This will allow you to quickly,
            conveniently, and safely arrange for a carpool.</p>

            <h1 align='center'>How the NOMAD Carpool System doesn't Work</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As an android app. Right now the Nomad Carpool system is web based software. However, there are plans to bring the Nomad system to
                a mobile environment in the near future.</p>
