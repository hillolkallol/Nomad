            <h1 align="center">Careers at Nomad</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 align="center">Application/Interview Process</h3>
            <p>Here at Nomad we hire only the brightest and most talented. If you think you've got what it takes, show us. We encourage you
            to hack this website, use social engineering to steal our CEO's identity, do whatever it takes to make us hire you. Good Luck!</p>  
            <p>Should you actually manage to make it through the initial interview process alive, and in good physical condition with relatively intact
                mental health, you will be subjected to an intensive basic training process. During this time you will complete a serious
                of strenuous physical and mental challenges designed to train Russian agents during the cold war. You will also receive a
                booklet full of one time pads as all communication would be encrypted from this point onwards.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 align="center">Employee Life</h3>
            <p>Have you ever heard about what it is like to work at Google? Well multiply that by ten, divide it by four, and then multiply it by eight.
                That's right, we are like Google times twenty! So come work for us and learn our slogan: Nomad, the power of twenty Googles.</p>
            <p>Another great reason to work for the Nomad Carpool System Inc. is all of the free food. Our campus has five different five star chefs
                all of whom work at five star dining establishments located in five different locations across the campus. Through soul crushing contracts we have forced these chef's to
                abandon their hopes and dreams and do nothing other then cook, twenty four seven, for our employees for the rest of their lives. So come work
                for Nomad, enjoy our wonderful campus, and eat as much free food as you want. All it costs you is a quarter of your salary every month.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 align="center">Salaries</h3>
            <p>Every single one of our employees makes at least a six figure salary. Combined with your choice of payment in two different currencies
                the Nomad compensation plan is unbeatable. Be it Pesos or Rupees, you can take your salary anywhere!</p>
            <p>Once a month merit based raises are given to employees who deserve them. Merit will be based on a monthly triathlon. Raises will be 
                given based on position you finish in the triathlon. The first half of employees, who obviously completed the triathlon fastest, will
                receive in increase in their pay relative to how they finish. The second half of employees will receive a dock in their pay. This will 
                provide both an incentive for the sub par employee, as well as a way to facilitate the raises without having to put extra strain on the
                yearly budget.</p>
