            <h3 align='center'>General Information</h3>
            <p><strong>Fun Fact,</strong> The Nomad Carpool System originally started out as facial recognition software.
            However, due to concerns of both security and complexity, as well as a general desire to make the world a better place, the facial
            recognition project was set aside, and the Nomad Carpooling webapp was born. </p>
            <p>The Nomad Carpool system was designed to be the most intelligent, most innovative, and most energy efficient carpool app on the
            market. Built with an extremely user friendly interface, we are confident our user base will quickly surpass the likes of Uber
            or Lyft.</p>
            <p><strong>Another interesting fun fact</strong> is that the name Nomad, is actually an acronym. N.O.M.A.D. stands for Nearly Official
                Magic Android Device. Actually, each of those words is actually an acronym as well. Unfortunately, we cannot let you know what N.E.A.R.L.Y
                O.F.F.I.C.I.A.L M.A.G.I.C. A.N.D.R.O.I.D. D.E.V.I.C.E. stands for though, as that is a classified trade secret.</p>
            <p>The Nomad Carpool system is so innovative that private investors have given the company a ten billion dollar evaluation. Bill Gates even
                offered to purchase the entire company, however we declined his offer.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 align='center'>No Russian Affiliation</h3>
            <p>On behalf of all the staff here at Nomad we would like to remind you that Nomad Carpool Systems Inc. no longer does business
                with the K.G.B. In fact, Nomad Carpool Systems Inc., it's parent companies, and it's owners have not had ties with the soviet union
                since the early 90's.</p>
            <p>Trust us, you can trust us!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 align='center'>Safe</h3>
            <p>Your safety, or your money back, guaranteed. I mean, come on. What's not safe about getting into cars with strangers. That said,
            remember that you are using our service at no cost.</p>
            <p>All of our drivers must provide us with their drivers license as well as insurance information. This ensures that our riders will only
                be paired with relatively safe, or at the very least insured, drivers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
