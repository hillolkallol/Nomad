            <p><strong>Fun Fact,</strong> The Nomad Carpool System originally started out as facial recognition software.
            However, due to concerns of both security and complexity, as well as a general desire to make the world a better place, the facial
            recognition project was set aside, and the Nomad Carpooling webapp was born. </p>
            <p>The Nomad Carpool system was designed to be the most intelligent, most innovative, and most energy efficient carpool app on the
            market. Built with an extremely user friendly interface, we are confident our user base will quickly surpass the likes of Uber
            or Lyft.</p>
            <p><strong>Another interesting fun fact</strong> is that the name Nomad, is actually an acronym. N.O.M.A.D. stands for Nearly Official
                Magic Android Device. Actually, each of those words is actually an acronym as well. Unfortunately, we cannot let you know what N.E.A.R.L.Y
                O.F.F.I.C.I.A.L A.N.D.R.O.I.D. D.E.V.I.C.E. stands for though, as that is a classified trade secret.</p>
