            <li>[Q] So.., is your software like Uber or Lyft? [A] No, our software is completely different. Not even remotely similar, in

            <li>[Q] Is it free to use your software? [A] Yes, but you can pay us if you want.</li>
            <li>[Q] Will I be paid to be a driver? [A] Not really, although riders will pay you some gas money.</li>
            <li>[Q] Does it cost money to be a rider? [A] Sort of, you will have to pay the Driver some gas money.</li>
