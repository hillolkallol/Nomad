        <ul>
            <li>[Q] So.., is your software like Uber or Lyft?    [A] No, our software is completely different. Not even remotely similar, in 
                any way shape or form. Any perceived likeness is the fault of the end user.</li>
            <li>[Q] Is it free to use your software?    [A] Yes, but you can pay us if you want.</li>
            <li>[Q] Will I be paid to be a driver?    [A] Not really, although riders will pay you some gas money.</li>
            <li>[Q] Does it cost money to be a rider?    [A] Sort of, you will have to pay the Driver some gas money.</li>
            <li>[Q] Is my data secure?    [A] Hopefully, that seems like the sort of thing you should know.</li>
            <li>[Q] What is your privacy policy?    [A] Your privacy is our policy.., unless money is involved.., in which case.., money is our policy</li>
            <li>[Q] How can I submit a complaint?    [A] Easy, you can't! We were so confident in the Nomad Carpool System's user interface that
                we neglected to create a way for our users to complain.</li>
            <li>[Q] When was Nomad started?    [A] Here at Nomad we've been in business for a long time. Trust me.</li>
            <li>[Q] What do you do to mitigate and prevent radon in your driver's homes?    [A] Umm.., nothing?</li>
            <li>[Q] How many people does Nomad currently employ?    [A] Enough?</li>
            <li>[Q] What is a reasonable amount of questions to be on an FAQ page?    [A] Your guess is as good as mine.</li>
            <li>[Q] How many people use your software?    [A] It's probably safe to say at least one million.</li>
